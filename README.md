# IGRINS-Spectra
Help
# List in no particular order

- Issues with merging orders?
-  Dispersion issues? -> Contact Kyle Kaplan?
-  Compare RRISA reduced data to Nicole's
-  Create framework in python to do equivalent widths (integral of flux divded by continuum)
  - Fit a baseline?
  - Which spectral lines are sensitive to temperature?
  - Start with isolated lines  
- Find a line list
  - Luhman Taurus paper?
  - Check spectral types
- Br-gamma line luminosity (check proposal)
  - Flux/photospheric flux
  - Source Luminosity divided by Br-gamma Luminosity

## Poster things

- Show standards with some smoothing
- Take best sources to show veiling removal
- Reproduce some figures from the proposal
- Place sources on HR diagram -> Initial radii
  - subtract accretion luminosity
- Mass vs Radius relationship?
  - Birth line, Hartmann et al. 1997: https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1997ApJ...475..770H/abstract
  - Another paper that I can't seem to find because of course I can't (Hasegawa 2011?)
