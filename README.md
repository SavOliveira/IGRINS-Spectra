# IGRINS-Spectra
Help
# List in no particular order

- Issues with merging orders?
-  Dispersion issues? -> Contact Kyle Kaplan?
-  Compare RRISA reduced data to Nicole's
-  Create framework in python to do equivalent widths (integral of flux divded by continuum)
  - Fit a baseline?
  - Which spectral lines are sensitive to temperature?
  - Start with isolated lines  
- Find a line list
  - Luhman Taurus paper?
  - Check spectral types
- Br-gamma line luminosity (check proposal)
  - Flux/photospheric flux
  - Source Luminosity divided by Br-gamma Luminosity
